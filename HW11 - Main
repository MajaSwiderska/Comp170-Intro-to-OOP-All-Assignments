Holy digits Batman! The Riddler is planning his next caper somewhere on Pennsylvania Avenue. In his usual sporting fashion, he has left the address in the form of a puzzle. The address on Pennsylvania is a four-digit number where:
* All four digits are different
* The digit in the thousands place is 2 times the digit in the tens place
* The number is even
* The sum of the digits is 25

Write a program that uses a loop (or loops) to find the address where the Riddler plans to strike. Print out the address that matches the riddle.
