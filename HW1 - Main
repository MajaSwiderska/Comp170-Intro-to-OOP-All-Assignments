Comp 170 – First Java Program 

2. Content 
Summary: Working from a simple Hello World program (or any simple starting 
point of a program that *works*), make at least the changes and additions listed 
below.  You can add more, try other things, but be sure your program compiles 
without errors and runs correctly before turning it in.  If you have something that 
is “good enough” you might save that as is and make a copy to continue trying 
new things. 
Programming is often about *trying* solutions and seeing what happens. 
Use the Console methods print, println, and nextLine in your program to give 
information to the user at the Console and get user input into your program.  You 
may wish to also use System.out.println for output but it is not required. 
See the textbook, Chapter 1, section 1.1, to understand the Console concept. 
Your Virtual Machine (VM) has a version of software called Console that 
implements this concept. 
Turn in your java program with these items: 
a. In addition to Hello World, have your program print out a simple saying 
you like. 
b. Have the program prompt the user (you) for your name and save the 
input in a variable. 
c. Print out the results of doing some arithmetic like 1+2+3+4. 
d. Print out a longer saying of at least two lines. 
e. Tell the user (you) goodbye in some form (possibly a different 
language) when you finish. 
***In Comp 170, you will get 0 (ZERO) points for programs that do not 
compile in the correct version of the tools as used in class***
