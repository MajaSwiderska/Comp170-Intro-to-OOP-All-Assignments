First, write the method called printTriangleType referred to in Self-Check Problem 25. This method accepts three integer arguments representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle and prints the type of triangle that these sides form.  Second, test your method by calling it from main with several different values, or by getting user input in main and passing it to the method.

Here are some sample calls to printTriangleType:

printTriangleType(5, 7, 7);
printTriangleType(6, 6, 6);
printTriangleType(5, 7, 8);
printTriangleType(2, 18, 2);

The output produced by these calls should be

isosceles
equilateral
scalene
***will cause exception and end program***

Your method should throw an IllegalArgumentException if passed invalid values, such as ones where one side’s length is longer than the sum of the other two, which is impossible in a triangle. For example, the call of printTriangleType(2, 18, 2); should throw an exception.
